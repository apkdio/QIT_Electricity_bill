This is a file used to query the electricity bills of QIT dormitories, written based on Python 3. 
It involves the basic use of Python crawlers and the tkiner library, which is also some of the gains I have learned during this period of time. 
As my first independently written Python project with a GUI, it has a great significance for me
You can use `pyinstaller -F QIT(GUI).py` to package it into an exe file
